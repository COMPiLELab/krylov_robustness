Please see the attached code for the miobi-breakedge (and similar for the other two) in matlab.

To run this, you will just need to type in this line 

[robScoreNoUpdate, robScoreUpdate50] = MIOBIBreakEdge2(fname,k,topT)

fname is expected to be an adjacency matrix (sparse) 
k is the number of edges you want to remove 
topT is the number of eigenvalues you want to use to compute the rob. score (we use 25)

For example: to generate column 1 of table 2 for MIOBI-Naive and MIOBI-RC@50, you can do 

(first load dt_oregon.mat) 

[naive, rcat50] = MIOBIBreakEdge2(A0,543,25)

A0 is the O-A dataset.
